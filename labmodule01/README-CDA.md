# Constrained Device Application (Connected Devices)

## Lab Module 01

Be sure to implement all the PIOT-CDA-* issues (requirements) listed at [PIOT-INF-01-001 - Lab Module 01](https://github.com/orgs/programming-the-iot/projects/1#column-9974937).

### Description

NOTE: Include two full paragraphs describing your implementation approach by answering the questions listed below.

What does your implementation do? 

This chapter revolved around getting our development environment set up, so we can continue working on the rest of the lab modules. We ran the provided unit and integration tests to ensure that our environments were set up correctly. We also set up a github repository so that our work can be combined easily.

How does your implementation work?

We have the same github repository installed on both of our computers so that we can work on the same codebase at the same time.

### Unit Tests Executed

NOTE: TA's will execute your unit tests. You only need to list each test case below
(e.g. ConfigUtilTest, DataUtilTest, etc). Be sure to include all previous tests, too,
since you need to ensure you haven't introduced regressions.

- ConfigUtilTest

### Integration Tests Executed

NOTE: TA's will execute most of your integration tests using their own environment, with
some exceptions (such as your cloud connectivity tests). In such cases, they'll review
your code to ensure it's correct. As for the tests you execute, you only need to list each
test case below (e.g. SensorSimAdapterManagerTest, DeviceDataManagerTest, etc.)

- ConstrainedDeviceAppTest
